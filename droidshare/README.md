Files in [shared storage](https://github.com/Android-for-Python/Android-for-Python-Users#shared-storage) can be shared with other apps.

This example uses the Android ShareSheet. The target app is either specified in the sharing app or selected by the user with the ShareSheet.

The example also uses the Android Chooser to select one or more files to share.

There are two other shared storage examples [shared_storage_example](https://github.com/Android-for-Python/shared_storage_example) and [share_receive_example](https://github.com/Android-for-Python/share_receive_example).
